# jodhpur-villages-analysis
This project aims to analyse the data and collect important insights from it using various machine learning techniques and algorithms. For this project i have analysed the Jodhpur city's village directory data. I have showed all the resources and facilities provided in each village using an interactive D3 dashboard. Based on this i have predicted which of the villages are developed, developing and non developed.
